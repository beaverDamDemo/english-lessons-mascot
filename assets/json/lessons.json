    "help": "Two ways to tell time: the 12-hour format (AM/PM) and the 24-hour format. In the 12-hour system, 'AM' means morning hours (from midnight 00:00 until before noon 11:59), and 'PM' means afternoon and evening hours (from 12:00 noon until 11:59 at night). For example, 7 AM is early morning, while 7 PM is evening. In the 24-hour system, the day is counted continuously from 00:00 (midnight) to 23:59. So 7 AM is written as 07:00, and 7 PM is written as 19:00. This format is often used in timetables, tickets, and international communication because it avoids confusion.\n\nในภาษาอังกฤษมีสองวิธีหลักในการบอกเวลา คือ ระบบ 12 ชั่วโมง (AM/PM) และระบบ 24 ชั่วโมง ในระบบ 12 ชั่วโมง 'AM' หมายถึงเวลาตั้งแต่เที่ยงคืน (00:00) จนถึงก่อนเที่ยงวัน (11:59) ส่วน 'PM' หมายถึงเวลาตั้งแต่เที่ยงวัน (12:00) จนถึงก่อนเที่ยงคืน (23:59) เช่น 7 AM คือเวลาเช้า ส่วน 7 PM คือเวลาเย็น ในระบบ 24 ชั่วโมง วันจะถูกนับต่อเนื่องตั้งแต่ 00:00 จนถึง 23:59 ดังนั้น 7 AM จะเขียนเป็น 07:00 และ 7 PM จะเขียนเป็น 19:00 ระบบนี้มักใช้ในตารางเวลา ตั๋วเดินทาง และการสื่อสารระหว่างประเทศ เพราะช่วยลดความสับสน.",
